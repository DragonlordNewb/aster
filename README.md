# ASTER
## Advanced SpaceTime Engineering Research software, in Python and GUI format

This is a little applet I wrote for simulating the geometries and behaviors of spacetime when subjected to different energy configurations, spacetime metrics, etc. It's written as a Python module that can be imported, used, and extended, but it also has a built-in GUI module.

Depending on which mode of operation being used, the app can be imported/run by either

```py
>>> import aster
```

for the Python package, or

```bash
 $ py aster.py # on Windows; or
 $ python3 aster.py # on Linux.
```

for the windowed applet.

The code should be well-enough documented to provide a basic understanding of how to use and extend the module itself. On the other hand, the applet has documentation that can be found at this repository's wiki.
